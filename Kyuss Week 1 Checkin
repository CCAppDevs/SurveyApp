I think the survey main page should be just one page, no skipping through page after page, just load up survey, answer survey, then load to submit answers

I know we cannot capture any user data so a ctclink id check is out of the question, but what about a recaptcha check or something, just to insure that they are actually students
taking the quiz?

Simple, easy to read questions is the priority, no confusing colors, no distracting menus, just the survey, a submit button, a menu button (maybe), and then a title in the top left.

I think its very important that the survey is targeted for mobile use, especially insuring that we don't have any of that crap with all the scroll wheels that happen when things 
are not formatted for mobile correctly, and you have to scroll just to read the entire question.

I think having like a maximum of 10-12 questions would be best, something quick for students to breeze through inbetween classes
